Make a Class
------------

Q1. Whatâ€™s const-correctness and why is it important?
A1. Const-correctness means adding a const keyword to any variable
that should not be changed or any function that should not alter
member variables of the class. This will allow the compiler
or editor to throw errors upon attempting to change 
a const item.

Q2. Is your class const-correct? How do you know?
A2. All (1) functions that do not change member variables are marked
const. Also, all (2) members that do not change are marked const.
Therefore the class is const-correct.
